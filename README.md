### Mining Clinical Notes for Mortality Prediction

Unstructured clinical data such as nursing notes
are very less used to build a predictive model for
post-discharge mortality despite containing rich
information. Our work examines a simple bag of
words model approach for 7/30/180/365 day mortality prediction. We also explored syntactic sentiment dimensions from these nursing notes as
a predictor of mortality, and report preliminary
survival analysis results too. Our simple BOW model
using XGBoost achieved **0.92 AUC** for 30-day
mortality.
