	Data were extracted from the MIMIC databases using
	\textbf{Google Big Query} with the help of dialect of Structured Query Language (SQL)

	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Notes identified by physicians as errors (indicated by the \texttt{iserror} column in the MIMIC-III
		nursing notes table ) were excluded.
		\item We considered only patients whose age $\in ~ $[$15,85 $].
